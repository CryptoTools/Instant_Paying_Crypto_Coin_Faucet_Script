To install

01. Create a database to use with the faucet.
02. Import \ServerRoot\db.sql in to you database you created and then delete db.sql
03. Edit \ServerRoot\private_html\config.php with your database and coins RPC credentials.
04. Upload \private_html\ and \public_html\ to your servers root directory.
05. Your domain should be aimed at \public_html\, keeping \private_html\ out of the public scope.

That is it. Your script should now be ready to use.

The faucet is set to send from the account "" by default. So create an addres with no label in 
the client, or using command line use "" as the acount name. Coins sent to that account are the 
coins used in/sent from the faucet.
